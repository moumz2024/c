# TODO: Remove Banner Between Sections and Fix Social Icons

## Tasks to Complete

- [x] Add Font Awesome CDN link to index.html for icon support
- [x] Replace text-based social links in footer with Font Awesome icons (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub)
- [x] Remove alternating background and backdrop-filter from .section in styles.css to eliminate banner effect
- [x] Verify changes by opening index.html in browser (sections blend seamlessly, icons display properly)
